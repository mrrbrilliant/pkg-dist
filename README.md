# KOOMPI OS 3

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

We honestly admit that KOOMPI OS version 2 is fully depended on ArchLinux ecosystem.
Thanks to rich and sophisticated WiKi of ArchLinux, We have learnt a lot from Arch.
It empowered us to be very agile in development speed. However, since KOOMPI OS is
meant for general consummer, the user experiences were not so good. Due to the fact
that ArchLinux is always bleeding edge. Users often meet bugs, yet we appreciate that
because bugs are good teachers. In our conclusion, ArchLinux is very good for developers
to learn but not as good for general users.

**INTRODUCTION**

KOOMPI OS 3 focuses on stabilty, simplicity, performance, and integration, so from KOOMPI
hardware to its software, everything must be very reliable, inarguably understandale at
glance, and efficiently fast. This project aims to distinguish KOOMPI OS as an independent
Linux based operating system through building its own toolsets to embrace opensource software
adoption for a better and free-er digital society.
