# **KOOMPI OS 3**

## INTRODUCTION

**Background**

We honestly admit that KOOMPI OS version 2 is fully depended on ArchLinux ecosystem.
Thanks to rich and sophisticated WiKi of ArchLinux, We have learnt a lot from Arch.
It empowered us to be very agile in development speed. However, since KOOMPI OS is
meant for general consummer, the user experiences were not so good. Due to the fact
that ArchLinux is always bleeding edge. Users often meet bugs, yet we appreciate that
because bugs are good teachers.

**Solution**

KOOMPI OS 3 focuses on stabilty, simplicity, and performance, so from KOOMPI hardware
to its software, everything must be very reliable, inarguably understandale at glance,
and efficiently fast.

This project aims to derive KOOMPI OS as an independent Linux based distribution
through building and having its own toolsets for embracing and distributing opensource
software using the following tools:

- PI Package Manager

- PI Package Builder

- KOOMPI Application Store

- Free and Open Repository
